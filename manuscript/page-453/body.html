  And in sad cypress let me be laid;
Fly away, fly away, breath,
  I am slain by a fair cruel maid.</p></blockquote><p>My shroud of white stuck all with yew, O prepare it!
My part of death no one so true did share it.</p><blockquote><p>Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
  On my black coffin let there be strewn:
Not a friend, not a friend greet
  My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown.</p></blockquote><p>A thousand thousand sighs to save, lay me O where
Sad true lover never find my grave, to weep there!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Viola did not fail to mark the words of the old song,</p></div> </div>
