<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Silvia I give it up to you.”</p><p>Julia, who was standing beside her master as a page, hearing this strange offer, and fearing Proteus would not be able with this new-found virtue to refuse Silvia, fainted; and they were all employed in recovering her, else would Silvia have been offended at being thus made over to Proteus, though she could scarcely think that Valentine would long persevere in this overstrained and too generous act of friendship. When Julia recovered from the fainting fit, she said:</p><p>“I had forgot, my master ordered me to deliver this ring to Silvia.”</p><p>Proteus, looking upon the ring, saw that it was the one he gave to Julia in return for that which he received from her and which he had sent by the supposed page to Silvia.</p><p>“How is this?” said he. “This is Julia’s ring. How came you by it, boy?”</p></div> </div>
