He, not meaning she should be quite starved, had brought her a small portion of meat, and he said to her:</p><p>“How fares my sweet Kate? Here, love, you see how diligent I am. I have dressed your meat myself. I am sure this kindness merits thanks. What, not a word? Nay, then you love not the meat, and all the pains I have taken is to no purpose.” He then ordered the servant to take the dish away.</p><p>Extreme hunger, which had abated the pride of Katharine, made her say, though angered to the heart, “I pray you let it stand.”</p><p>But this was not all Petruchio intended to bring her to, and he replied, “The poorest service is repaid with thanks, and so shall mine before you touch the meat.”</p><p>On this Katharine brought out a reluctant “I thank you, sir.”</p></div> </div>
