<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">spotted snakes, with double tongue,
  Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Newts and blind-worms do no wrong;
  Come not near our fairy queen:
“Philomel, with melody,
Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby;
Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,
Come our lovely lady nigh;
So, good night, with lullaby.”</p></blockquote><p>When the fairies had sung their queen asleep with this pretty lullaby, they left her to perform the important services she had enjoined them. Oberon then softly drew near his Titania and dropped some of the love-juice on her eyelids, saying:</p><blockquote><p>“What thou seest when thou dost wake,
 Do it for thy true-love take.”</p></blockquote></div> </div>
